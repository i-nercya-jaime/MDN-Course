    <p> <h1> Basic HTML Animals</h1></p>
    <p> This is the firs paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>
    <p> <h2> The Llama</h2></p>
    <p> Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweetsm licking her lips as she goes.</p>
    <p> <h2> The Anaconda</h2></p>
    <p> The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.</p>
